# Umbrella Grommets
These are little grommets for mounting table umbrellas into barrels.  Use a hole saw to drill the center of the top and bottom barrel head, and then press thes into that hole.  Use a little construction adhesive if you'd like.  Insert the umbrella. The umbrella will be held firmly and won't wobble.
